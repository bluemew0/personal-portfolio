          Magdalena Carmen Frida Kahlo y Calderón (July 6, 1907 – July 13,1954) was a Mexican painter known for her many portraits, self-portraits, and works inspired by the nature and artifacts of Mexico.</p>
          
        <p>Inspired by the country's popular culture, she employed a naïve folk art style to explore questions of identity, postcolonialism, gender, class, and race in Mexican society. Her paintings often had strong autobiographical elements and mixed realism with fantasy. In addition to belonging to the post-revolutionary Mexicayotl movement, which sought to define a Mexican identity, Kahlo has been described as a surrealist or magical realist. She is known for painting about her experience of chronic pain.</p>

          <p class="caption">Viva la Vida, Watermelons. This was Kahlo's last work before she passed away. Watermelons have hard shells that protect the soft flesh inside. When you bite into the flesh, you experience cool, juicy sweetness. A watermelon could symbolize the artist herself, who had to develop a thick skin to weather a life marked with physical pain.</p>

          <p class="caption">Me and My Parrots (1941). The parrots bring depth, the intricate detailing of their feathers providing a subtle contrast to the smooth simplicity of Frida's appearance. The ruffled, protective parrots enhance the sensual tactility of the work, the calm simplicity of Kahlo's mien magnified against them.</p>
