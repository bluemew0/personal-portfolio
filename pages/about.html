                        <p class="itim description">I'm currently a 4th year at UC Santa Cruz studying <span class="emphasis">art and design for games and playable media</span> (AGPM).
                        I am expected to graduate in June 2023.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="itim description">I am interested in creating art and illustrations for games as well as designing and creating websites. 
                            I've always wanted to be able to apply my art in more modern and digital ways and I think these two fields fulfill those interests.
                            I have worked on a couple of game projects and would love to work on more! I am interested in games that focus on story and characters
                            as well as strong aesthetics and visuals.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="itim description">Outside of school and art, I like to play games, take photos, and explore other art forms like video editing.</p>
