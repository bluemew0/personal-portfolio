                            <p class="itim">Love Heist Romeo is a 2D narrative-driven exploration game about a bunny named Romeo on his quest for True Love. Follow a wizard’s advice down a rabbit hole to interact with cute animals, collect magical orbs, and discover doors to whimsically colorful worlds!</p>
                            <p class="itim ">I worked on Love Heist Romeo as an environment artist, drawing the bases for the different neighborhoods in the game based on the level designer's layouts. I also helped with some of the promotion art for the game and refining some of the decor pieces done by our other environment artist, Lucky Medikonda. This is a 2021 senior capstone project at UCSC.</p>
                            <p class="itim ">Below are drafts, concepts, final artwork, and game screenshots of my contributions.</p>
                            <p class="itim">You can find more information and play the game <a target="_blank" href="https://loveheistromeo.itch.io/love-heist-romeo">here</a>.</p>

                            <p class="itim">Fragments of You is a platformer all about collecting the parts of your partner. While going about collecting these parts, the player will need to sacrifice their own parts to unlock those of their partners. In losing parts the player will also lose certain movement options associated with the parts lost.</p>
                            <p class="itim ">This is a 2022 senior capstone game that I helped out with as a pixel background artist. I created and designed the backgrounds using a moodboard defined by the senior creative team. You can see my concept art, drafts, and finished products down below.</p>

                            <p class="itim">Slumber the Sea is a turn-based, combat RPG . Play as 3 aspiring dreamers as they fight against nightmare monsters in a fantastical, shared dream! The twist? Every party member offers a unique resource and playstyle based on different types of JRPGs! Play in frantic and dynamic battles with tons of surprising and strategic teamwork combos using each characters' unique abilities! Will you be able to master your dream career and escape this underwater dream world?</p>
                            <p class="itim ">I participated in this game as a 2D artist and I created environment concept art, character portraits, UI boxes, background tile sprite, and a combat diagram. I'm very satisfied with how my environment concept art and character portraits turned out. My initial environment concept art explored different dream settings and after receiving fondness for the underwater setting, I decided to explore that further in combination with urban cityscape to convey a sense of urban escapism and dystopia.</p>

                            <p class="itim">A series of games made with the same prompt of "One Button" and the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/abagames/crisp-game-lib">Crisp Game Library</a>. With a limited time of 2 weeks to learn this new library, I had to work with 3 people, 1 person, and myself to make 3 games. Listed below are the games made in order and the photos are also in order.
                                <ul class="itim">
                                    <li><h4 class="fredoka-one">Firefly Catch</h4>
                                        <p>Created with Leon Chen, Dylan Higashionna, Rachel Trieu. I worked on creating the jar sprite and implementing it. Because this was the first game using the Crisp Game Library, I focused on just learning my way with the library.</p>
                                        <p>You can play the game <a target="_blank" href="https://dylhigashi.github.io/Jam1OneButton/docs/?firefly">here</a>.</p>

                                    <li><h4 class="fredoka-one">Color Beats</h4>
                                        <p>Created with Neo Zhang. Together, we worked on the design of the game and I worked on the visuals of the game. In making this game, we were able to figure out how animations worked and so we added that to this game.</p>

                                    <li><h4 class="fredoka-one">Playing with Fire</h4>
                                        <p>For this game, I worked alone, meaning I also had to code the game. I faced some challenges, especially in trying to calculate the circular spawning and the state changes but I think I was able to combine everything I learned about this library into this game.</p>

                            <h2 class="fredoka-one py-3" id="mock">Mock Game</h2>
                            <p class="itim">Set in urban Asian city life, the main character traverses through the city with a magical cat companion to find their missing friend. The game would be a point-and-click adventure with a focus on a colorful, magical aesthetic, inspired by my time in Shanghai and other East Asian cities. Vending machines would be checkpoints in the game.</p>
                            <p class="itim">I created characters, assets and a mockup screen for a concepted game for a class in order to get familiar with the game art pipeline and learn different tools. I first started with character concept art of the main character and her animal companion using a set color palette. I then moved on to create environment and UI mockups in Illustrator, and animating all of these pieces together in After Effects to get a sense of how the game would feel. After that, I created a pixel environment based on the environment mockup and a new character asset, which be close to final artwork in this mock game.
